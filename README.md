## üß† Concept of HEAD
Imagine Git as a timeline of commits, and `HEAD` is a pointer to your **current branch's latest commit**.

Think:
```
HEAD ‚Üí branch ‚Üí commit
```

When you switch branches or checkout a specific commit, `HEAD` changes accordingly.

## üé® Visual 1: HEAD pointing to a branch

Let‚Äôs say your Git repo looks like this:

```
A --- B --- C (main)
              ‚Üë
            HEAD
```

- Commits A, B, and C are in the history.
- `main` branch points to commit `C`.
- `HEAD` points to the `main` branch.

**Key idea**: `HEAD` is indirectly pointing to commit `C` via `main`.

So:
```bash
$ git branch
* main
```

## üß™ Visual 2: HEAD after a new commit

You make a new commit `D`:

```
A --- B --- C --- D (main)
                    ‚Üë
                  HEAD
```

- Git moves `main` to `D`.
- `HEAD` moves along because it's pointing to `main`.

## üîç Visual 3: Detached HEAD (Important Case)

Now imagine checking out a **specific commit**:

```bash
$ git checkout B
```

Git now detaches `HEAD` ‚Äî it's not pointing to a branch, but directly to a commit:

```
A --- B --- C --- D (main)
      ‚Üë
    HEAD (detached)
```

Now, you're in **detached HEAD state**.

If you commit here:

```bash
$ echo "test" > test.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Temp commit"
```

```
A --- B --- C --- D (main)
      \
       E (new commit)
       ‚Üë
     HEAD (detached)
```

- Commit `E` exists but is **orphaned** if you don't create a branch!
- To save it:  
  ```bash
  git switch -c temp-work
  ```

Now:
```
A --- B --- C --- D (main)
      \
       E (temp-work)
            ‚Üë
          HEAD
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Handy Commands to See HEAD

```bash
# See where HEAD points
$ cat .git/HEAD

# Output:
ref: refs/heads/main

# See actual commit
$ git rev-parse HEAD
```

## üí• HEAD in Action

| Action | What HEAD Points To |
|--------|---------------------|
| `git checkout main` | The tip of the `main` branch |
| `git checkout <commit>` | A specific commit (detached HEAD) |
| `git commit` | Creates a commit on the current branch HEAD is pointing to |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1` | Moves HEAD and branch pointer back one commit |

---

## üß© Summary

- `HEAD` is **your current position in Git**.
- Usually points to a branch (normal state).
- Can point directly to a commit (detached HEAD state).
- Every Git operation moves or uses `HEAD`.
